  Trivial Disappointment is a last person standing trivia game that is free to play and can be run on any internet ready smart device. The rules are simple, be the last one remaining or the fastest in the game. Answer just one wrong question and you are out the game (In which case you should feel bad). The game ends when there is one last person in the game or in the case of a tie the fastest. This person will be the ultimate champion of knowledge whilst the loser(s) will be trivially disappointed. Questions are split into categories and are complety random thanks to the free to use trivia database API
